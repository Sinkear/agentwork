// Frontend mirror of internal/service/codes.go. There is no test that

// a manual addition here. Codes use the AW.xxxxxxxx format so the real
// frontend (AI_Shell_WEB) can look them up in the remote term.json for a
// localized message. The self-test web/ only verifies the backend outputs
// the correct code/detail — it does not query term.json.
