// ── The engineered context system (决策 6-22) ──
//
// Every prompt is assembled from exactly two pieces:
//
//   - the FIXED BLOCK (platform / goal / self / tools) — the task message;
//   - the WAKE LINE (who woke you + anchor + reason/task) — injected every
//     turn.
//
// The TEAM (squad roster + playbook + leader protocol) is per-run PERSONA
// material: it rides the workdir's AGENTS.md (shipped in the dispatch
// payload, merged by the executor at spawn — see buildTeamProfile), never
// the prompt. The comment feed is PULLED via `agentwork goal comments`,
// never injected wholesale (决策 4-6 revised: the wake line carries the
// triggering words, the feed is the shared context the agent pulls on
// demand).

// buildFixedBlock renders the session-fixed context (决策 6-22): platform
// intro, goal, the agent's own identity + role contract, and the CLI tool
// surface. Written in English (platform text is English, 决策 6-18); the
// MATERIALS (titles, instructions, names) keep their own language.
